# Private events

> We are building a site similar to a private Eventbrite that allows users to create events and manage user signups. Users can create and attend events. Events take place at a specific date and a location.  A user can create events. A user can participate in many events. Many users can attend an event. This will require you to model many-to-many relationships.
